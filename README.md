# Traffic

This is a rewrite of a very old `Trafic.exe` app used by students to, well, calculate traffic.  
This one does basically the same thing, except it works correctly on modern software.

## Installation

Make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed and is available in your PATH.  
To check this, try running `python3` in your command prompt

1. Download this project as zip and unpack it somewhere.
2. Run `install_windows.bat` if you are using Windows 7 or above. 
For macOS and GNU/Linux, run `install_linux_macos.sh` instead.
3. Check for errors. If there are none, installation succeeded.

If installation is successful, `launcher.bat` (on Windows) or `launcher.sh` (on macOS and GNU/Linux) should appear.
Use it to start the app.
