# Traffic

This is a rewrite of a very old `Trafic.exe` app used by students to, well, calculate traffic.  
This one does basically the same thing, except it works correctly on modern software.

## Installation

Make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.

Run `install_windows.bat` if you are using Windows 7 or above.  
For macOS and GNU/Linux, run `install_linux_macos.sh` instead.

If installation is successful, `launcher.bat` (on Windows) or `launcher.sh` (on macOS and GNU/Linux) should appear.
Use it to start the app.
